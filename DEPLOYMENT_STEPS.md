## ⚠️ Important: Database Setup Required

Your site will be live, but to make it fully functional, you need MongoDB:

### Quick MongoDB Atlas Setup:

1. **Go to:** https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas
2. **Sign up** (FREE)
3. **Create cluster** (M0 Free tier)
4. **Create user** (save password!)
5. **Allow IP:** 0.0.0.0/0 (anywhere)
6. **Get connection string**

### Add to Vercel:
```bash
vercel env add MONGODB_URI production
# Paste: mongodb+srv://user:password@cluster.mongodb.net/resumeforge

vercel env add JWT_SECRET production
# Type: resumeforge-secret-2024

vercel env add NODE_ENV production
# Type: production
```

### Redeploy:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Project not found"
✅ **This is NORMAL!** Just answer "N" when asked "Link to existing project?"

```bash
npm run build:css
```
