**Description:** 
```

**"...or import code from another repository"**

**Find this link:** "uploading an existing file" (it's clickable text)

### Step 7: Success! 🎉

Your repository is now live at:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/resumeforge

## ✅ Verify Upload

Check that these exist in your repository:

- ✅ `README.md` displays on the main page
- ✅ `package.json` is visible
- ✅ Folders: `controllers`, `models`, `routes`, `pages` all appear
- ✅ About 50+ files uploaded

---

## 🔒 Security Check

**Make sure these are NOT uploaded:**
- ❌ `.env` file (check it's not in the file list)
- ❌ `node_modules` folder (should not be there)

If you accidentally uploaded `.env`:
1. Delete the file from GitHub
2. Go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
3. Rotate any exposed keys/secrets immediately!
